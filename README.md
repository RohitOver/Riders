# Riders
The folder contains one python file &amp; 2 text files.
The python file riders.py converts the strings in the text files to respective JSON objects to python dictionaries. Presumably there will be an external function that keeps adding these text files as they come & keeps appending the 'directory' variable in riders.py.

**EXECUTION :**

(Have all the files in the same directory)

    $ python3 riders.py
